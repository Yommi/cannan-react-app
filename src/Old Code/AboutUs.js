          REV. EMMANUEL OSET has been called to the pastoral office with a
          specific commission of tending, treating and strengthening the
          brethren and delivers those taken captives by the enemy in the onward
          march to the measure of Christ. God, having signified this to His
          servant, confirmed it through many witnesses who testified by open
          vision and prophetic utterances. This responsibility often manifests
          itself as he goes about doing good and fanning the kingdom’s smoking
          flaxes back to flames. The plan of God is to raise a people who will
          be impossible for the enemy to crack but who themselves will be fully
          His battle axes and weapons of war to execute His everlasting counsels
          on the forces of Darkness!

      <header class="head">OUR HISTORY</header>
      <p class="sionp" style="margin-top: 5vh">
        God Almighty commissioned this ministry to have a part in the last day’s
        move of the Holy Spirit to raise a company of champions who through the
        finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ will wreak havoc on the kingdom
        of darkness. Implicit in that is the burden to tend, treat and
        strengthen God’s people and deliver those taken captive by the enemy in
        the onward march to the fullness of the measure of the stature of Christ
        (Eph. 4:11-13). There is of course the burden for the lost. Like all of
        God’s people, our congregations are to be mobilized and galvanized into
        aggressive but agape-directed evangelism.<br />
        Thirdly, Canaan Ministries carries a special burden for the maturing of
        the saints. We know that the Lord having delivered His people from Egypt
        destined them for the fullness of the Promised Land. Therefore we share
        this burden of the Lord to build God’s saints to the place where they
        can fully represent the Lord here on earth in character and charisma.<br />
        Another emphasis in the commission that the Lord has established in
        Canaan is the provision of a regular rendezvous where ministers from
        diverse backgrounds and calling can come together to be encouraged,
        nurtured and re-fired to be increasingly fruitful and faithful unto the
        Lord. Our Ministers’ Conference is one of the devices for achieving this
        purpose. The Lord has confirmed this burden by bringing a host of
        ministers who have asked to relate to the Lord’s servant as a stimulus
        to their fulfilling God’s call on their lives.
